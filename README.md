# Games Database Creator
 Creates a sqlite3 database out of all of the games you own on Steam.

 The app is run by running the get_games.py file, and providing your Steam ID. <br />
 The ID is found here on your steam profile link: steamcommunity.com/id/**YourIDFoundHere**/

 Once you provide the program with the file, you will see an sqlite database file in the directory.
 This file is a populated SQLITE3 database with all of your Steam games. The schema is provided in tables.sql.
